#+title:Telegram pipeline


Project made for the course data analysis from EBAC (British School of Creative Arts in portuguese) the goal of this project was to create a system to save the messages of a telegram group into a s3 bucket from AWS and then perform the cleaning and enrichment of the data using lambdas functions, the project can be divided into 3 parts: telegram bot, the storage process and the cleaning process. Bellow a image that shows this process.

*(Telegram bot

To create the bot, you need to follow these steps:

    1. Access the website [https://web.telegram.org]
    2. In the search bar, type “BotFather ”
    3. Send the message “ /newbot” to create a new bot
    4. Give a name to the bot, it can be any name
    5. Create a username for the bot, it must be unique, and it must end with“ _bot ”
    6. The bot father will send a message with the token to use the API, save this token in a safe place
    7. To recover the token of your bot, send the message “ /mybots”, select the bot that you want to recover the token then select the option “API TOKEN ”

With the bot created, we need to do some configurations:

    1. Create a group in the telegram
    2. Add the bot in the group
    3. Give it the administrator role
    4. Start a new conversation with the “BotFather ”
    5. Send the message “ /mybots”, then select the option “Bot Settings” to configure your
    6. Select the options “Allow groups” then turn it off

Now to see if the bot is working as intended, run this python script:

#+BEGIN_SRC python

from getpass import getpass
import json
import requests

# this will ask for the API token
token = getpass()

response = requests.get(url=f'{base_url}/getMe')
print(f'{base_url}/getMe')

# It must return the bot information
print(json.dumps(json.loads(response.text), indent=2))
#+END_SRC
